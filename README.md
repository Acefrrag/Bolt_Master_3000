#Bolt Master 3000

##Description
This github repositories collects all the documentation(CAD files, reports, BOMs, brainstorming notes) produced during the design and development of a proof-of-concept mechatronic system for the undergraduatee course MECA140 - Introduction to Engineering Design and Automation.

##Project Description

The aim of the proof-of-concept system was to explore ways to automatize the process of checking proper bolt installation on a generic structure.

The proof-of-concept system objective is to test the proper installation of 4 bolts in 1/4-20 holes on a 2-by-4-inch-area stainless steel fixture, to ensure bolt preload is present on all of them. 

My team designed the Bolt Master 3000. The hardware part deploys a set of 4 DC motors and a pneumatic actuator to target all the bolt simultaneously. Then, depending on the amount of current drained by each motor (using a shunt resistor) it is possible to infere wheather the bolts were correctly screwed in.
